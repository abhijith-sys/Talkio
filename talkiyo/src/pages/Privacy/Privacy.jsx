                <p>We, Talkiyo, are an internet-based mobile phone application by M/s Talkiyo LLP, and this document uses the words “we” and Talkiyo interchangeably, and “you” and “users” interchangeably. The expression “we” covers both Talkiyo and M/s Talkiyo LLP, as and when the context allows.</p>
                <p>Terms “We”, “Talkiyo”, “M/s Talkiyo LLP”, covers their respective current or former employees, officers, directors, agents, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, divisions, or affiliated corporations.</p>
                <p>The users’ right to privacy is of paramount importance to the Talkiyo community.</p>
                <p>We take data security and privacy with critical importance. We obligate ourselves to maintain a no-leak and no-disclosure business as any private and sensitive data must receive proportioned protection. In our application, users and providers, or ‘listeners’, are in control and can decide what they want to share and what they prefer to keep private.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any information you share with us by your own choosing is ‘redacted’, ‘obscure’, and ‘censored’ from everyone, including the employees of Talkiyo, as well as the external ‘listeners’ we bring in, for your engagement.</li>
                    <li>The information or data you share with our ‘listeners’ or otherwise, is for “your eyes only”. We only retain the basic minimum information like name, age, email ID,Phone Number, for the registration process.</li>
                    <li>We do not send you messages without your permission.</li>

                    <li>We do not share data with any third party, whatsoever.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, Talkiyo may, with your implied permission, use the basic information and data provided by you, to provide a more personalized online experience.</p>
                <p>Talkiyo stores any data entered by the user in a very secured format deterring any leakage or misuse.</p>
                <p>No “sensitive personal data” is collected or stored and used as per the required legal guidelines. We emphasize and actively inform all users to avoid sharing any “sensitive personal data” with anyone related to, or connected to, or representing Talkiyo.</p>
                <p>The only purpose of collecting any basic or required information is to provide you with a more secure experience to the real-time users and enable the ‘listeners’ to address and engage the users, coherently and cogently.</p>
                <p>In general, you can visit Talkiyo’s portal without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when Talkiyo may need information from you. Only in such incidences, as disclosed, Talkiyo reserves the right to gather the information and use it according to the terms mentioned.</p>
