                        our mission is to create meaningful connections and reduce social isolation by providing a platform where anyone can monetize their time and listening skills. We believe in the transformative power of conversation and the significant impact of having someone to talk to, whether itâ€™s to share happiness or seek solace during challenging times.                    </span>

                        Talkiyo LLP was born from the realization that in today's fast-paced, digitally-driven world, many individuals experience loneliness and isolation. At the same time, there are countless people with the willingness and time to offer a listening ear but no platform to facilitate this exchange. Talkiyo bridges this gap by creating a marketplace where people can buy and sell time, fostering genuine human connections.                    <br />

                    <br />
                    <span className={styles.contenSection}>
                        The inspiration behind Talkiyo came from the growing need for accessible, empathetic listeners who can provide support without the barriers of formal therapy or counseling. We envisioned a platform where anyone, regardless of their background, can find someone to talk to or offer their listening skills, making emotional support both affordable and flexible.                    <br />
